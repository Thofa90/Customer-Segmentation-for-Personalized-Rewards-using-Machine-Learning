Customer Segmentation for Personalized Rewards – TravelTide

⸻

# 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and segment TravelTide’s user base in order to identify which perks (e.g., free cancellation, discounts, upgrades) individual customers are most likely to value. These insights will be used to design a personalized rewards program that maximizes engagement and retention.

# 🏢 Business Context

TravelTide is a fast-growing e-booking startup that has built a competitive advantage by offering the largest travel inventory in the industry. However, the company faces challenges in customer retention.

To address this, Elena Tarrant (Head of Marketing) is leading a personalized rewards program. The hypothesis is that different customers value different perks, and by emphasizing the right perk for each customer, TravelTide can significantly increase sign-ups for the rewards program and strengthen long-term loyalty.

As part of the Analytics team, our task is to:

	1.	Validate whether distinct customer segments exist based on preferences for perks.
	2.	Assign each customer a likely favorite perk to personalize marketing campaigns.

# 🌍 Real-World Impact

•	Personalized Marketing → Customers receive reward invitations highlighting perks most relevant to them, improving engagement.

•	Higher Retention → A tailored rewards program builds loyalty and keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform.

•	Revenue Growth → Increased retention leads to repeat bookings, lower churn, and stronger lifetime customer value (LTV).

•	Scalable Strategy → The segmentation framework can be extended to new perks, destinations, or campaigns, making TravelTide’s marketing efforts more data-driven and effective.
